# Installation for Langstone Transceiver

The preferred installation method only needs a Windows PC connected to the same (internet-connected) network as your Raspberry Pi.  Do not connect a keyboard or HDMI display directly to your Raspberry Pi.

- First download the 2019-26-09 release of Raspbian Buster Lite on to your Windows PC from here  https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2019-09-30/2019-09-26-raspbian-buster-lite.zip

- Unzip the image and then transfer it to a Micro-SD Card using Win32diskimager https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

- Before you remove the card from your Windows PC, look at the card with windows explorer; the volume should be labeled "boot".  Create a new empty file called ssh in the top-level (root) directory by right-clicking, selecting New, Text Document, and then change the name to ssh (not ssh.txt).  You should get a window warning about changing the filename extension.  Click OK.  If you do not get this warning, you have created a file called ssh.txt and you need to rename it ssh.  IMPORTANT NOTE: by default, Windows (all versions) hides the .txt extension on the ssh file.  To change this, in Windows Explorer, select File, Options, click the View tab, and then untick "Hide extensions for known file types". Then click OK.

- Connect the 7" touchscreen display, USB mouse, USB Sound Card, and Pluto now.   Power up the RPi with the new card inserted, and a network connection.  Do not connect a keyboard or HDMI display to the Raspberry Pi. 

- Find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi using an IP Scanner (such as Advanced IP Scanner http://filehippo.com/download_advanced_ip_scanner/ for Windows, or Fing on an iPhone) to get the RPi's IP address 

- From your windows PC use Putty (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) to log in to the IP address that you noted earlier.  You will get a Security warning the first time you try; this is normal.

- Log in (user: pi, password: raspberry) then cut and paste the following code in, one line at a time:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g4eml/Langstone/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The initial build can take some time, however it does not need any user input, so go and make a cup of coffee and keep an eye on the touchscreen.  When the build is finished the Pi will reboot and start-up with the Langstone Transceiver
